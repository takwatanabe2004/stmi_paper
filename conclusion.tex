\section{Conclusion}\vspace{-4pt}
We presented a multitask structured sparse SVM, a multitask extension to the connectome-based disease classification method introduced in~\cite{Watanabe:2014}, where the imaging sites are treated as \emph{tasks}.
Experimental results on the multisite \mbox{ADHD-200} dataset suggest that the multitask approach using the \MTL-penalty can provide improvement in classification performance over the naive \emph{pooling approach}, where a single classifier is trained on the entire multisite dataset. % (an approach predominantly adopted in the original ADHD-200 competition).
In addition, the \MTL-penalty achieved higher AUC scores than the single-task \STL-penalty, and the \emph{group variable selection} property of the multitask approach gives a more interpretable model by selecting the same set of features across sites, which can be visualized compactly in brain space.
